Question 1: In the "Tiny Habits" video, what was the most interesting story or idea for you?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The most powerful idea is how celebration reinforces behavior.
Why It Stands Out: BJ Fogg explains that attaching a positive emotion (like joy or pride) immediately after doing a habit helps wire it into brain.
Example Impact: Instead of waiting for big results, build success by feeling good about small wins — even just flossing one tooth or doing one push-up.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Question 2: How can you use B = MAP to make making new habits easier? What are M, A, and P?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
B = MAP formula stands for:--
M (Motivation): The desire to perform the behavior.
A (Ability): The capacity to perform the behavior.
P (Prompt): The trigger that initiates the behavior.
To make new habits easier:--
Increase Ability: Make the habit so simple that it's hard to say no. For example, instead of committing to a 30-minute workout, start with a 2-minute stretch.
Decrease Motivation Requirements: Choose habits that don't require high motivation. For instance, a 2-minute habit is easier to perform than a 20-minute one.
Use Effective Prompts: Anchor the new habit to an existing routine. For example, "After I brush my teeth, I will meditate for 1 minute."
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Question 3: Why is it important to "Shine" or celebrate after each successful completion of a habit?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Celebration locks in the habit emotionally.
It activates positive feelings like pride or joy, which help the brain tag the habit as "important."
It builds confidence, reinforcing your identity as someone who follows through.
Without a positive emotional response, the habit is just another task — and it's easier to ignore or forget.

Question 4: In the "1% Better Every Day" video, what was the most interesting story or idea for you?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Power of Tiny Gains: Improving just 1% each day might not feel like much, but over time, these small changes compound into massive transformation.
Consistency over intensity: You don’t need dramatic changes — just small, steady progress.
Build brick by brick: Success comes from what you do daily, not occasionally.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Question 5: What is the book's perspective about Identity?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
James Clear's "Atomic Habits" introduces the idea of identity-based habits. Instead of focusing on what you want to achieve, focus on who you wish to become. For example, instead of saying "I want to run a marathon," say "I am a runner." This shift in identity makes the desired behavior a natural part of who you are, leading to more sustainable habits.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Question 6: Write about the book's perspective on how to make a habit easier to do.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
strategies to make habits easier:
Reduce Friction: Make the habit as easy as possible to start. For instance, lay out your workout clothes the night before.
Two-Minute Rule: Start with habits that take less than two minutes. This lowers the barrier to entry.
Environment Design: Shape your environment to make the desired habit easier. For example, keep healthy snacks visible and within reach.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Question 7: Write about the book's perspective on how to make a habit harder to do.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To make bad habits harder:
Increase Friction: Add steps to the behavior. For example, if you want to reduce screen time, keep your phone in another room.
Use Commitment Devices: Set up systems that lock you into good behaviors. For instance, prepaying for a gym membership can increase the likelihood of attending.
Change Your Environment: Surround yourself with cues that promote good habits and remove those that trigger bad ones.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Question 8: Pick one habit that you would like to do more of. What are the steps that you can take to make it make the cue obvious or the habit more attractive or easy and or response satisfying?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Let's take the habit of reading more:
Make the Cue Obvious: Place the book on your pillow or next to your coffee maker.
Make It Attractive: Pair reading with something enjoyable, like a cup of your favorite tea.
Make It Easy: Start with just 2 minutes of reading each day.
Make It Satisfying: Track your progress and celebrate each completed reading session.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Question 9: Pick one habit that you would like to eliminate or do less of. What are the steps that you can take to make it make the cue invisible or the process unattractive or hard or the response unsatisfying?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Make cue invisible: Turn off notifications and hide apps in folders.
Make it unattractive: Remind yourself how it drains time and energy.
Make it harder: Log out or delete apps from your phone.
Make it unsatisfying: Track your usage and feel the disappointment of wasted time (use apps like Forest or Screen Time).
