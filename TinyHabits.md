Question 1: In the "Tiny Habits" video, what was the most interesting story or idea for you?
In BJ Fogg's "Tiny Habits" video, one of the most compelling ideas is the concept of "celebration" after performing a new habit. Fogg emphasizes that immediately celebrating a small win, no matter how minor, reinforces the behavior and makes it more likely to stick. This approach shifts the focus from relying solely on motivation to creating a positive emotional association with the new habit.

Question 2: How can you use B = MAP to make making new habits easier? What are M, A, and P?
B = MAP formula stands for:--
M (Motivation): The desire to perform the behavior.
A (Ability): The capacity to perform the behavior.
P (Prompt): The trigger that initiates the behavior.
To make new habits easier:--
Increase Ability: Make the habit so simple that it's hard to say no. For example, instead of committing to a 30-minute workout, start with a 2-minute stretch.
Decrease Motivation Requirements: Choose habits that don't require high motivation. For instance, a 2-minute habit is easier to perform than a 20-minute one.
Use Effective Prompts: Anchor the new habit to an existing routine. For example, "After I brush my teeth, I will meditate for 1 minute."

Question 3: Why is it important to "Shine" or celebrate after each successful completion of a habit?
Celebration, or "Shining," is crucial because it creates a positive emotional response that reinforces the behavior. This emotional reinforcement helps in forming habits by associating them with positive feelings, making it more likely to repeat the behavior. Fogg's approach emphasizes that the act of celebrating, no matter how small, is more effective than relying solely on motivation.

Question 4: In the "1% Better Every Day" video, what was the most interesting story or idea for you?
The concept of "compounding habits" is particularly striking. Just as compound interest grows wealth exponentially, small, consistent improvements accumulate over time, leading to significant personal growth. This idea underscores the power of incremental progress and the importance of consistency in habit formation.

Question 5: What is the book's perspective about Identity?
James Clear's "Atomic Habits" introduces the idea of identity-based habits. Instead of focusing on what you want to achieve, focus on who you wish to become. For example, instead of saying "I want to run a marathon," say "I am a runner." This shift in identity makes the desired behavior a natural part of who you are, leading to more sustainable habits.

Question 6: Write about the book's perspective on how to make a habit easier to do.
strategies to make habits easier:
Reduce Friction: Make the habit as easy as possible to start. For instance, lay out your workout clothes the night before.
Two-Minute Rule: Start with habits that take less than two minutes. This lowers the barrier to entry.
Environment Design: Shape your environment to make the desired habit easier. For example, keep healthy snacks visible and within reach.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Question 7: Write about the book's perspective on how to make a habit harder to do.
To make bad habits harder:
Increase Friction: Add steps to the behavior. For example, if you want to reduce screen time, keep your phone in another room.
Use Commitment Devices: Set up systems that lock you into good behaviors. For instance, prepaying for a gym membership can increase the likelihood of attending.
Change Your Environment: Surround yourself with cues that promote good habits and remove those that trigger bad ones.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Question 8: Pick one habit that you would like to do more of. What are the steps that you can take to make it make the cue obvious or the habit more attractive or easy and or response satisfying?
Let's take the habit of reading more:
Make the Cue Obvious: Place the book on your pillow or next to your coffee maker.
Make It Attractive: Pair reading with something enjoyable, like a cup of your favorite tea.
Make It Easy: Start with just 2 minutes of reading each day.
Make It Satisfying: Track your progress and celebrate each completed reading session.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Question 9: Pick one habit that you would like to eliminate or do less of. What are the steps that you can take to make it make the cue invisible or the process unattractive or hard or the response unsatisfying?
Let's consider the habit of checking social media excessively:
Make the Cue Invisible: Turn off non-essential notifications and move social media apps to a less accessible screen.
Make It Unattractive: Remind yourself of the negative impacts, such as time wasted or decreased productivity.
Make It Hard: Log out of accounts after each use or use apps that limit screen time.
Make the Response Unsatisfying: Use apps that track and report your usage, highlighting time spent on social media.
