# Firewall Report

## 1. Introduction
- A **firewall** is a security device or software that controls traffic between networks.
- It acts as a barrier between a trusted internal network and untrusted external networks.

## 2. Purpose of Firewalls
- Prevent unauthorized access.
- Block malicious traffic.
- Monitor and log network activity.
- Enforce organizational security policies.

## 3. Types of Firewalls

### a. Packet-Filtering Firewall
- Inspects headers of packets (IP, port, protocol).
- Fast and simple.
- Works at the **network layer**.
- Limited in deep traffic inspection.

### b. Stateful Inspection Firewall
- Tracks the state of active connections.
- Allows packets that match known sessions.
- More secure than packet-filtering firewalls.

### c. Proxy Firewall
- Intermediary between client and server.
- Operates at the **application layer**.
- Inspects content of packets.
- Adds latency but provides better filtering.

### d. Next-Generation Firewall (NGFW)
- Combines traditional firewall features with:
  - Deep Packet Inspection (DPI)
  - Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS)
  - Application-level awareness
- Can detect modern threats like malware and exploits.

### e. Software vs. Hardware Firewalls
- **Software Firewall**: Runs on individual devices (e.g., Windows Firewall).
- **Hardware Firewall**: Dedicated appliance for network protection (e.g., Cisco ASA).

## 4. Firewall Rules
- Define allow/deny conditions based on:
  - IP addresses
  - Ports
  - Protocols
  - Applications
- Evaluated in sequence (top-down order).

## 5. How Firewalls Work
- Intercept data packets entering/leaving a network.
- Apply filtering rules.
- Log and monitor decisions.
- Can be placed at network perimeter or between segments.

## 6. Firewall Architectures

### a. Bastion Host
- Hardened device placed outside the internal firewall.
- Exposes limited services to the public (e.g., web server).

### b. DMZ (Demilitarized Zone)
- Buffer zone between internal network and the internet.
- Hosts public-facing services (e.g., mail, DNS).

### c. Dual-Homed Host
- Two network interfaces for separating internal and external traffic.
- Can be used for traffic inspection and control.

## 7. Limitations of Firewalls
- Cannot protect against:
  - Insider threats
  - Phishing attacks
  - Social engineering
- May be bypassed by encrypted traffic (e.g., VPNs, HTTPS).
- Require regular updates and monitoring.

## 8. Use Cases
- **Enterprise Networks**: Control and secure internal and external access.
- **Home Networks**: Protect devices from internet-based threats.
- **Cloud Environments**: Use virtual firewalls to protect cloud resources.

## 9. Popular Firewall Solutions

### Software:
- Windows Defender Firewall
- iptables (Linux)
- pfSense

### Hardware:
- Cisco ASA
- Palo Alto Networks
- Fortinet FortiGate
- Sophos XG

## 10. Conclusion
- Firewalls are critical for maintaining network security.
- They should be part of a multi-layered defense strategy.
- Regular updates, monitoring, and integration with other security tools enhance their effectiveness.
