#Grit and Growth Mindset#

Question 1
Paraphrase (summarize) the video in a few (1 or 2) lines. Use your own words.
=>In a world that's always pushing us, success often hinges on two crucial qualities: passion and perseverance. They're powerful on their own, but truly unstoppable when combined.
Passion is that deep excitement and joy you feel for something. It's the inner spark that makes you eager to dedicate extra effort, learn, and innovate, transforming work into a calling.
But passion needs a partner. Perseverance is your stubborn commitment to keep going, even when things get tough. It's the resilience to bounce back from failures, learn from mistakes, and adapt your approach.
The real magic happens when they work together. Passion gives you the "why" – the compelling reason to push forward. Perseverance gives you the "how" – the sustained effort to navigate challenges. Without passion, perseverance can feel like a joyless grind. Without perseverance, passion might just remain a dream.
History is full of examples: scientists, artists, and entrepreneurs who achieved greatness because their initial passion drove them, and their unwavering perseverance helped them overcome every obstacle.
Ultimately, by finding what truly excites you and committing to the hard work it takes, you unleash your full potential and make a real impact.

Question 2
Paraphrase (summarize) the video in a few (1 or 2) lines in your own words.
=>A growth mindset is the belief that your fundamental abilities, intelligence, and talents aren't set in stone. Instead, you understand that you can develop and improve these qualities through dedication, hard work, and continuous learning.
It's about seeing challenges as opportunities to grow, not as roadblocks. When faced with a setback, someone with a growth mindset doesn't think, "I'm not good enough," but rather, "What can I learn from this? How can I improve?" They embrace feedback, knowing it's a valuable tool for progress, and they find inspiration in the success of others.
This contrasts sharply with a fixed mindset, where people believe their abilities are inherent and unchangeable. Those with a fixed mindset often avoid challenges to prevent failure, fear criticism, and feel threatened by others' achievements.
Ultimately, adopting a growth mindset means you have an unshakable belief in your capacity to learn and evolve. It fosters a lifelong love of learning, boosts resilience, and significantly increases your chances of achieving your goals, both personally and professionally. It's about always striving to be a better version of yourself, knowing that your potential is limitless.

Question 3
What is the Internal Locus of Control? What is the key point in the video?
=>Internal locus of control is a psychological concept that describes the extent to which individuals believe they have control over the outcomes of their lives and experiences. Simply put, if you have an internal locus of control, you believe that your successes and failures are primarily a result of your own actions, efforts, and choices, rather than external factors like luck, fate, or other people.
              The key point of an internal locus of control is personal agency and responsibility. It signifies a belief that you are the primary driver of your own destiny. This leads to several important characteristics:
                      Taking ownership: Individuals with an internal locus of control are more likely to take responsibility for both their achievements and their mistakes.
                      Proactivity and effort: They believe that hard work, strategic decisions, and continuous effort will lead to desired results.
                      Resilience: When faced with setbacks, they are more likely to learn from them and adapt their approach, rather than feeling helpless or giving up.
                      Motivation: This belief system fuels motivation, as people feel their actions truly make a difference in their lives.
                      Less influenced by external opinions: They tend to be more independent and less swayed by what others think, as they trust their own judgment and actions.

Question 4
What are the key points mentioned by speaker to build growth mindset (explanation not needed).
=>Embrace challenges: See difficulties as opportunities for learning and growth, not as threats.
View failure as a learning opportunity/temporary setback: Don't let mistakes define you; instead, extract lessons from them.
Believe intelligence and talent can be developed: Understand that abilities are not fixed but can improve with effort.
Welcome and apply feedback: See feedback as constructive criticism and a chance to get better, rather than a personal attack.
Incorporate "yet": Use "yet" in your vocabulary to signify that current limitations are temporary (e.g., "I can't do it yet").
Focus on effort and strategies (process praise): Recognize and reward the process of learning and trying, not just innate ability.
Reflect on failures and what was learned: Take time to acknowledge and learn from areas where things didn't go well.
Change your attitude/alter your thoughts: Actively replace negative or pessimistic thoughts with more positive and proactive ones.
Practice mindfulness: Be aware of your thoughts and emotions to make conscious choices.
Set clear, realistic goals: Have specific targets to work towards.
Appreciate the journey: Value the learning and growth that happens along the way, not just the outcome.
Seek out new experiences/get out of your comfort zone: Deliberately try new things to expand your capabilities.
Find your purpose: Connect your efforts to a larger meaning to sustain motivation.
Celebrate the success of others: Be inspired by others' achievements and learn from them.

Question 5
What are your ideas to take action and build Growth Mindset?
=>Actively Seek Out Challenging Projects and Tasks: Instead of sticking to what you know, volunteer for features that push your current skills, involve new technologies, or require complex problem-solving. This could mean tackling an unfamiliar API, optimizing a slow system, or architecting a new module.
Embrace and Learn from Every Bug and Error: Don't see bugs as failures, but as invaluable puzzles. When a bug appears, delve deep into understanding its root cause. Document the issue, your debugging process, and the solution. This transforms frustration into a powerful learning experience.
Regularly Solicit and Act on Code Review Feedback: View code reviews not as judgment, but as a gift of diverse perspectives. Actively ask for constructive criticism, even on areas you feel confident about. Implement the suggestions and reflect on how they improve your code and understanding.
Dedicate Time to Deliberate Learning (Beyond Project Work): Set aside specific time each week to learn new languages, frameworks, design patterns, or best practices that aren't immediately required for your current project. This could involve online courses, tutorials, reading technical blogs, or contributing to open-source.
Practice "Yet" Thinking: When encountering a difficult concept or a task you can't immediately perform, reframe your internal dialogue from "I can't do this" to "I can't do this yet." This small linguistic shift reinforces the belief in your ability to learn and improve.
Focus on the Learning Process, Not Just the Outcome: Celebrate the effort you put into understanding a complex algorithm, the persistence in debugging a tricky issue, or the patience in mastering a new tool, even if the immediate outcome isn't perfect. Recognize that every attempt is a step in your growth.
Engage in Pair Programming and Collaborative Learning: Actively seek out opportunities to pair with more experienced developers or even peers. Sharing knowledge, discussing different approaches, and solving problems together fosters a collective growth environment and exposes you to new ideas.
Maintain a "Learning Journal" or "Wins Log": Keep a record of new concepts you've learned, challenging problems you've solved, and the skills you've acquired. This provides tangible evidence of your progress and helps combat imposter syndrome.
Set Small, Achievable Learning Goals: Break down large learning aspirations (e.g., "master React") into smaller, manageable steps (e.g., "complete 3 React tutorials this week," "build a small React component"). Achieving these mini-goals builds momentum and confidence.
Reflect on Your Learning Journey: Periodically take time to look back at how far you've come. What seemed impossible a few months ago might now be routine. This reflection reinforces your growth and motivates you for future challenges.
