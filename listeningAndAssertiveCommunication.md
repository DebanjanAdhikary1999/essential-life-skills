# Listening and Assertive Communication

---

## Question 1: What are the steps/strategies to do Active Listening? (Minimum 6 points)

### A. Maintain Eye Contact
Maintaining eye contact shows the speaker that you are focused and engaged. It communicates respect and attentiveness without saying a word. It also helps you avoid distractions and keeps your mind from wandering. Eye contact doesn’t mean staring continuously—just natural, consistent attention that reassures the speaker they are being heard.

### B. Avoid Interrupting
Let the speaker express their full thoughts without cutting in. Interrupting can make someone feel dismissed or unimportant and disrupts the flow of communication.

### C. Provide Feedback (Verbal and Non-verbal)
Use small verbal cues like “I see,” “Right,” or “That makes sense” to show you are actively following the conversation. Nodding, smiling, or leaning slightly forward are effective non-verbal signs of attentiveness.

### D. Ask Clarifying Questions
If any part of the message is unclear, ask for clarification. Example: “Could you explain that further?” or “What did you mean by...?”

### E. Paraphrase or Summarize
Restate what the speaker said in your own words. Example: “So what you're saying is…” or “Let me see if I understand you correctly…”

### F. Avoid Distractions
Put away phones, close tabs, and focus entirely on the speaker. Avoid multitasking, especially in professional settings.

## Question 2: According to Fisher's Model, What are the Key Points of Reflective Listening?

### A. Paraphrasing
Restate the speaker’s message in your own words.  
**Example:**  
- Speaker: “I’ve been really stressed at work lately.”  
- You: “So, it sounds like your job has been overwhelming recently.”

### B. Mirroring Emotions
Reflect the speaker’s emotions.  
**Example:**  
- Speaker: “I can’t believe they overlooked me for the promotion.”  
- You: “That sounds really frustrating and disappointing for you.”

### C. Clarification
Ask for more details when needed.  
**Example:** “When you say the team didn’t support you, what do you mean exactly?”

### D. Summarization
Briefly recap the main points to ensure mutual understanding.  
**Example:** “So, to sum up—you’re feeling stressed because of the increased workload, and you’d like more support from the team, right?”

### E. Non-Verbal Cues
Use:
- Nodding
- Comfortable eye contact
- Slight leaning-in
- Relaxed, attentive facial expression

### F. Feedback
Respond in a way that shows understanding.  
**Example:** “I can see how much this has affected you. Thanks for sharing that with me.”
